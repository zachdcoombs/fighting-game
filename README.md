# Vanilla JavaScript 2D Fighting Game

A simple vanilla JS that allows two players to control a sprite on screen. First player to die loses! 

# Controls: 
Player One is controlled using the A and D keys to move left and right, respectively; W to jump and the Space Bar to attack

Player Two is controlled utilizing the arrow keys in the same manner: left and right, up key is jump, down key is attack

# Known Issues
- Currently you can jump as often as you'd like
- There are no screen bounds so you're free to walk off either side of the map as well as jump out of the top of it

# This is the inital commit

In the future I'd like to address the bugs listed above and add some additonal game logic like a replay button, and intro screen possibly; 
that kind of thing.
